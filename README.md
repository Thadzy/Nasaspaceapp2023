## Introduction

EMIT (Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation) is a NASA Earth Ventures-Instrument (EVI-4) Mission designed to map the mineral composition of arid dust source regions using imaging spectroscopy in the visible and short-wave infrared range. The mission aims to model the role of mineral dust in the radiative forcing (warming or cooling) of the atmosphere.

## Mission Details

- Developed at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
- Launched on July 14, 2022.
- Observes Earth from outside the International Space Station.
- Data is delivered to the NASA Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) for use by researchers and the public.

## About Methane Gas Detection

EMIT is equipped to detect methane gas emissions. Methane is a significant greenhouse gas, and EMIT helps in pinpointing locations of large methane releases. The information provided by EMIT contributes to understanding and addressing the impact of methane on global climate change.

## How to Deal with Methane Gas

Reducing methane emissions is crucial for limiting global warming. Here are some steps that can be taken:

- **Upgrade Infrastructure:** Prevent and contain or seal methane leaks from sources that use fossil fuels, oil, or gas.
- **Transition to Renewable Energy:** Increase the use of renewable energy sources to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
- **Manage Organic Waste:** Reduce the amount of organic waste in landfills, as it contributes to methane emissions.
- **Improve Wastewater Treatment:** Implement better wastewater treatment systems to minimize methane release.
- **International Cooperation:** Establish procedures for managing, monitoring, and controlling methane release into the atmosphere.
